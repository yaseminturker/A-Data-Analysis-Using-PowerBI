# A-Data-Analysis-Using-PowerBI

***"Wherever there is data, there is data analytics."***

The process of determining how Human Resources (HR) data, such as the time to hire and retention rate, affect business success is known as HR analytics.

When used strategically, HR analytics can transform the way HR works, bring insight to the team and enable it to actively and meaningfully contribute to the organization's bottom line.

In this project, a company's HR dashboard was created using PowerBI.
